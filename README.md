# Atomic Buster

DApp powering a sustainable and exciting community by providing an open platform for competitors, community managers, bettors and sponsors.

## How?

Our smart contract allows flexible parameters so `competitors` are incentivized to win, `community managers` are incentivized to keep hosting events and `bettors` are incentivized to keep betting and supporting the community.

Check out our live demo at [rinkeby.atomicbuster.com](http://rinkeby.atomicbuster.com/)

## Compile, run and build

1. Compile and run the contract on either `ganache` or `rinkeby`

```

npm start
```
